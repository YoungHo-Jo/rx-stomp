# RxStomp

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/stomp-js/rx-stomp.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/stomp-js/rx-stomp)

This library provides a RxJS oriented STOMP over WebSocket client for Web browser or node.js
applications.

# Introduction

This is a wrapper over https://github.com/stomp-js/stompjs.
It exposes the STOMP operations as RxJS Observables.
It provides almost all operations provided by the underlying library.

This has been developed using TypeScript and includes typing information in the distribution.

## Work in Progress

More to come :)

## TypeScript definitions

The npm package includes TypeScript definitions, so there is no need no install it separately.
