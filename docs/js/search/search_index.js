key difference is that it exposes operations as RxJS Observables.\nFor example when a STOMP endpoint is subscribed it returns an Observable\nthat will stream all received messages.\nWith exception of beforeConnect, functionality related to all callbacks in\n@stomp/stompjs Client\nis exposed as Observables/Subjects/BehaviorSubjects.\nRxStomp also tries to transparently handle connection

It should be a\nUint8Array.\nSometimes brokers may not support binary frames out of the box.\nPlease check your broker documentation.\ncontent-length header is automatically added to the STOMP Frame sent to the broker.\nSet skipContentLengthHeader to indicate that content-length header should not be added.\nFor binary messages content-length header is always added.\nCaution: The broker will, most likely, report an error and disconnect if message body has NULL octet(s)\nand content-length header is missing.\nSee: https://stomp-js.github.io/stompjs/interfaces/publishParams.html\n   *        rxStomp.publish({destination: \"/queue/test\", headers: {priority: 9}, body: \"Hello, STOMP\"});\n   *\n   *        // Only destination is mandatory parameter\n   *        rxStomp.publish({destination: \"/queue/test\", body: \"Hello, STOMP\"});\n   *\n   *        // Skip content-length header in the frame to the broker\n   *        rxStomp.publish({\"/queue/test\", body: \"Hello, STOMP\", skipContentLengthHeader: true});\n   *\n   *        var binaryData = generateBinaryData(); // This need to be of type Uint8Array\n   *        // setting content-type header is not mandatory, however a good practice\n   *        rxStomp.publish({destination: '/topic/special', binaryBody: binaryData,\n   *                         headers: {'content-type': 'application/octet-stream'}});\n   *The message will get locally queued if the STOMP broker is not connected.

This issue is not specific\nto this library but the way STOMP brokers are designed to work.\nThis method in the underlying library is called subscribe.\nIn earlier version it was called subscribe here as well.\nHowever subscribe is also used by RxJS and code read quite strange with two subscribe calls\nfollowing each other and both meaning very different things.\nMaps to: https://stomp-js.github.io/stompjs/classes/Client.html#subscribe\n\n\n                            \n                                    Parameters :\n                                    \n                                        \n                                            \n                                                Name\n                                                    Type\n                                                Optional\n                                                    Default value\n                                            \n                                        \n                                        \n                                                \n                                                        destination\n                                                        \n                                                                    string\n                                                        \n                                                    \n                                                    \n                                                            No\n                                                    \n                                                    \n                                                        \n                                                        \n\n                                                \n                                                \n                                                        headers\n                                                        \n                                                                    StompHeaders\n                                                        \n                                                    \n                                                    \n                                                            No\n                                                    \n                                                    \n                                                        \n                                                                {}\n                                                        \n\n                                                \n                                        \n                                    \n                            \n                            \n                            \n                            \n                                Returns :     Observable\n\n                            \n                                \n                                    \n                                \n                    \n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                        \n                            \n                                Public\n                            watchForReceipt\n                            \n                            \n                        \n                    \n                \n                \n                    \n                            \n                        watchForReceipt(receiptId: string, callback: (frame: Frame) => void)\n                    \n                \n\n\n                        \n                            \n                                    Defined in src/rx-stomp.ts:476\n                            \n                        \n\n\n                \n                    \n                            STOMP brokers may carry out operation asynchronously and allow requesting for acknowledgement.\nTo request an acknowledgement, a receipt header needs to be sent with the actual request.\nThe value (say receipt-id) for this header needs to be unique for each use. Typically a sequence, a UUID, a\nrandom number or a combination may be used.\nA complaint broker will send a RECEIPT frame when an operation has actually been completed.\nThe operation needs to be matched based in the value of the receipt-id.\nThis method allow watching for a receipt and invoke the callback\nwhen corresponding receipt has been received.\nThe actual https://stomp-js.github.io/stompjs/classes/Frame.html\nwill be passed as parameter to the callback.\nExample:\n   *        // Publishing with acknowledgement\n   *        let receiptId = randomText();\n   *\n   *        rxStomp.watchForReceipt(receiptId, function() {\n   *          // Will be called after server acknowledges\n   *        });\n   *        rxStomp.publish({destination: TEST.destination, headers: {receipt: receiptId}, body: msg});\n   *Maps to: https://stomp-js.github.io/stompjs/classes/Client.html#watchForReceipt\n\n\n                            \n                                    Parameters :\n                                    \n                                        \n                                            \n                                                Name\n                                                    Type\n                                                Optional\n                                            \n                                        \n                                        \n                                                \n                                                        receiptId\n                                                        \n                                                                    string\n                                                        \n                                                    \n                                                    \n                                                            No\n                                                    \n                                                    \n\n                                                \n                                                \n                                                        callback\n                                                        \n                                                                    function\n                                                        \n                                                    \n                                                    \n                                                            No\n                                                    \n                                                    \n\n                                                \n                                        \n                                    \n                            \n                            \n                            \n                            \n                                Returns :     void\n\n                            \n                                \n                                    \n                                \n                    \n                \n            \n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            \n    \n        Accessors\n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                        stompClient\n                    \n                \n\n                \n                    \n                        getstompClient()\n                    \n                \n                            \n                                \n                                    Defined in src/rx-stomp.ts:114\n                                \n                            \n                    \n                        \n                                Instance of actual\n@stomp/stompjs\nClient.\nBe careful in calling methods on it directly -

Really I mean it.\nIf you don't believe me check details at https://www.rabbitmq.com/stomp.html#d.tqd\nWell the client code looks equally simple and similar to what you would expect\nto use with any backend service.\nThe StompRPCService can be created by means of Angular Dependency Injection\nor be created manually.\nIt in turns needs an initialized StompRService as\na dependency (or argument).\nStompService is a derived class of StompRService, so that will work as well.\n    const myServiceEndPoint = '/topic/echo';\n\n    const request = 'Hello';\n    // It accepts a optional third argument a Hash of headers to be sent as part of the request\n    stompRPCService.rpc(myServiceEndPoint, request).subscribe((message: Message) => {\n      // Consume the response\n      console.log(message.body);\n    });Just like Ajax requests, it will yield only once.\nThere is another method called stream that will not terminate after one response.\nThis can be used to receive stream of responses for a single request.\nIf you use that it will be your responsibility to unsubscribe when you do not expect\nany additional messages.\nOther Brokers\nThere are few requirements:\n\nthe reply queue name must be unique across the broker.\nideally, for security reasons only the client creating the queue should have access to it.\n\nMany brokers have temp-queue concept which should simplify your work. \nFollowing gives and outline:\n  const stompRPCConfigForActiveMQ = {\n    // A unique name, BTW angular2-uuid module is already added as dependency\n    replyQueueName: `/topic/replies.${UUID.UUID()}`,\n\n    // Simply subscribe, you would need to secure by adding broker specific options\n    setupReplyQueue: (replyQueueName: string, stompService: StompRService) => {\n      return stompService.subscribe(replyQueueName);\n    }\n  };This custom config would need to be passed as second parameter in StompRPCService\nconstructor, or, can be passed as an Angular Dependency.\nApart from this additional setup step usage remains same as RabbitMQ case as documented above.\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/sockjs-support.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/sockjs-support.html","title":"additional-page - SockJS Support","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing with SockJS\nSee sample at https://github.com/stomp-js/ng4-stompjs-demo/tree/sockjs\nAlmost all brokers that support SockJS also support WebSockets.\nIf your application does not need to support old browsers, switch to using WebSockets.\nCheck https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket for compatibility information.\nNotes\n\nIt is an initial release.\nInstead of a url in the default form, you need \nto pass it as a socketProvider function. It will be streamlined in a\nfuture release.\nPlease read notes on SockJS support of the underlying library at\nhttps://stomp-js.github.io/stomp-websocket/codo/extra/docs-src/sockjs.md.html\n\nUsage\nInstall SockJS Client\n$ npm install sockjs-client --saveImport SockJS class\nimport * as SockJS from 'sockjs-client';Implement a socketProvider\nCreate a function that returns an object similar to WebSocket (typically SockJS instance).\nexport function socketProvider() {\n  return new SockJS('http://127.0.0.1:15674/stomp');\n}StompConfig\nPass the function as url in StompConfig.\n It will work even\nthough name of the parameter is url, don't worry :)\nExample:\nconst stompConfig: StompConfig = {\n  // Which server?\n  url: socketProvider,\n\n  // Headers\n  // Typical keys: login, passcode, host\n  headers: {\n    login: 'guest',\n    passcode: 'guest'\n  },\n\n  // How frequent is the heartbeat?\n  // Interval in milliseconds, set to 0 to disable\n  heartbeat_in: 0, // Typical value 0 - disabled\n  heartbeat_out: 20000, // Typical value 20000 - every 20 seconds\n\n  // Wait in milliseconds before attempting auto reconnect\n  // Set to 0 to disable\n  // Typical value 5000 (5 seconds)\n  reconnect_delay: 5000,\n\n  // Will log diagnostics on console\n  debug: true\n};Limitations\nCopied from https://stomp-js.github.io/stomp-websocket/codo/extra/docs-src/sockjs.md.html\n\nSockJS is an emulation of WebSockets. This is not a complete implementation.\nHeart beating is not supported.\nSockJS internally uses one of many possible means to communicate. In some of those, auto reconnect may occasionally fail.\n\nWhen Hacking Code of this Library\n\nWhen developing on this library code to use SockJS, please adjust the unit tests to use\nSockJS.\nUnit testes may occasionally fail in SockJS. It is because of limitations\nof SockJS around allowing only one SockJS connection at a time. Usually \nthis should not affect your usage of the library.\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/change-log.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/change-log.html","title":"additional-page - Change Log","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChange Log\n0.1.0-beta.4 (2018-11-02)\n\nRolled back beta.3\nAlign with underlying library: waitForReceipt --> watchForReceipt\n\n0.1.0-beta.3 (2018-10-30)\n\nFailed, rolled back\n\n0.1.0-beta.2 (2018-10-28)\n\nUses @stomp/stompjs v5 properly\nInitial documentation\nRefactors and renames\ntslint clean\nRefactored specs \n\n0.1.0-beta.1 (2018-10-13)\n\nFactored out from https://github.com/stomp-js/ng2-stompjs\nBuild/test/doc systems are working\nTravis is setup\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/how-to-contribute.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/how-to-contribute.html","title":"additional-page - How to Contribute","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContributing\nHow to contribute\n\nFile issues.\nEdit/write documentation.\nSubmit pull requests.\nTest in different environments.\nRaise awareness.\n\nSummary of tools\nFollowing tools are getting used:\n\nTypeScript as primary language - https://www.typescriptlang.org/\ncompodoc for API documentation - https://compodoc.app/\nJasmine for test cases - https://jasmine.github.io/\nKarma for running test cases in browsers - http://karma-runner.github.io/\nwebpack for build - https://webpack.js.org/\nnodejs during development - https://nodejs.org/\nnpm for dependency management, packaging and distribution - https://www.npmjs.com/\ngit for version control - https://git-scm.com/\n\nInitial setup\nInstructions on setting up development environment:\n\nInstall node and npm - https://nodejs.org/\nCheckout code from GitHub - you may fork the code first into your GitHub account.\nUse npm i to install dependencies:  $ npm i\n\nProject structure\n\n├── LICENSE.md\n├── README.md\n├── bin/                     -- Scripts invoked from `npm` tasks\n├── bundles/                 -- Generated code browsers\n├── docs/                    -- Generated docs, root for GitHub pages\n├── docs-src/                -- Source for guides\n├── esm5/                    -- Generated ES5 modules\n├── index.d.ts\n├── karma.conf.js\n├── package-lock.json\n├── package.json\n├── rabbitmq/\n│   └── Dockerfile           -- This builds a docker image that is used to run test cases\n├── spec/                    -- These test cases run both for nodejs (using just Jasmine) and Chrome (Jasmine/Karma)\n│   ├── helpers/\n│   └── unit/                -- Test cases using Jasmine\n├── src/                     -- Typescript sources\n├── tsconfig.json\n└── webpack.config.jsSetup a Stomp broker\n\nA Stomp broker is used for running the tests.
